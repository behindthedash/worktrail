# Codifies the 2026-07-31 pilot's lessons (see design.md's "Evaluator prompt
# template" decision): repo-fetch-first, a bounded per-brief tool-call budget,
# a memory check before raising a false alarm, and fail-open-to-`keep` on any
# undecidable case. One spawn per repo group, so `{repo}`/`{briefs}` describe
# a whole group, not a single brief. Kept as a module-level constant (not a
# file) so `tests/workqueue/test_queue_triage.py` can assert on it directly,
# matching how `drain.py` keeps `PROMPT` as an importable constant.
EVALUATOR_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """\
You are triaging work-queue briefs for the repo group `{repo}` for staleness \
and duplication. Evaluate ONLY the briefs listed below; do not scan the queue \
for others.

Briefs in this group:
{briefs}

Step 1 — repo check (do this first, before judging any brief):
Run `gh repo view --json isArchived,name -- {repo}` (skip this step if `{repo}` \
is `{no_repo_key}` — these briefs are cross-cutting and have no target repo). \
If the repo is confirmed archived or renamed away, every brief in this group is \
`stale-close` on that fact alone — no further per-brief evidence is required. \
If the check fails or is inconclusive (network error, ambiguous name, etc.), \
proceed to step 2 for every brief as normal.

Step 2 — per-brief evaluation:
For each brief above, spend at most 3-4 tool calls (e.g. `git log`, `gh pr list \
--search`, `grep`) confirming or refuting the brief's premise. Cite the specific \
PR, commit, or file you found as evidence — a verdict without cited evidence is \
invalid.

Step 3 — memory check before raising an alarm:
Before flagging anything you observe as a live operational concern, check \
{memory_index} for whether it already documents the same state as expected or \
known. If it does, that is not new evidence of staleness or a problem — treat \
it as confirming the brief's premise rather than refuting it.

Step 4 — fail open:
If evidence is inconclusive after steps 1-3, do not guess: verdict `keep` and \
record what you checked and why it was inconclusive as the evidence.

For each brief, output one JSON object with exactly these fields:
{{"brief_id": "...", "verdict": "keep|stale-close|needs-update|duplicate-of", \
"duplicate_of": "<brief-id or null>", "evidence": "<cited PR/commit/file, or \
why inconclusive for a fail-open keep>", "confidence": "high|medium|low"}}
